Hey there, I wanted to show you a new feature which is cache
holdings in manual portfolios.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
You can now add a theoretical cache value in your manual
portfolio, which is helpful to

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
more closely illustrate the balance of your manual portfolio.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
This cache balance will be displayed and added to your all
holdings in all portfolio

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
balances too.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
So to add a cache balance, what we want to do is click on edit
portfolio, and then we'll

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
click at the bottom, edit lots.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,000
And at the bottom of this edit lots worksheet, there is a box to
add cache balance in portfolio.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I'm going to go ahead and add a value and hit save.

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
And once I hit save, you can see that the cache value is at the
bottom of my holdings tab,

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
and it even calculates the weight of the cache in my portfolio
too.

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
So the weight is updated as well as the overall balance of my
portfolio to reflect the cache

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
that I entered.

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
And as I said, this balance will also be added to your all
portfolios in all holdings pages.

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
So if we go to all holdings, we'll see all of our portfolios in
the holdings on one page.

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
If we scroll down to the bottom, we'll see cache, and if we
expand the row, we'll see

17
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
that there's cache in my income portfolio and my second
portfolio, and the corresponding

18
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:19,000
weights to each one of those cache balances with my overall
weights of all my holdings.

19
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I can also update the cache in my portfolio when I'm adding new
tickers to my portfolio.

20
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:33,000
So if I also click on the add symbol button and I find a ticker
and I hit next, I'll

21
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,000
be able to add in a number of shares, a date of purchase, and a
cost for the new ticker

22
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:44,000
in my portfolio, which I'll do.

23
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:50,000
And I can edit the cache balance on this modal as well and hit
save, and my cache

24
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
balance will be updated there as well.

25
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:58,000
So this is a new feature which is cache holdings in manual
portfolios that lets you add a

26
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
theoretical cache value to more closely illustrate the balance of
your manual portfolios.

27
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Thanks so much.
